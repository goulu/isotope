# isotope
a radioactive game in TypesScript

the game shows a small portion of the table of isotopes, centered on a current, stable isotope, such as Lead.
The playe should generate a new stable istotope, for example Gold, by bombarding the current isotope with neutrons, electrons or protons.
If unstable, the generated isotope will decay using realistic decay modes, such as alpha or beta decay, in a time proportional to the log of its half-life.
